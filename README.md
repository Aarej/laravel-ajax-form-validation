Its very easy to display error nicely in HTML file & also single javascript function for type of HTML form.

1. Put form.blade.php file in view folder(I used bootstrap.css for design)
2. Put myjs.js file public folder and and add it to html file using script tag.
3. Put UserController.php file in controller folder(I used http://image.intervention.io/getting_started/installation for handle image upload & display)
